A modern-ish React/Redux Single Page App, build mobile-first to provide an engaging, seamless

#### Fire Feed Web Client

## Getting started

`git clone ${repo_name}`

`gem install foreman`

**OSX**

`brew install yarn`

`yarn install`

`yarn add global http-server`

`foreman start`


This page runs get served locally on the node package "http-server". We therefore **need to connect to a local Rails server running the API**, [BC Fire Feed](www.github.com/aylanismello/bc-fire-api). See installation instructions for that separately.
