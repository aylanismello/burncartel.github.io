A modern-ish React/Redux Single Page App, build mobile-first to provide an engaging, seamless
listening experience for most, and an engaging exploration mode for some.
#### Fire Feed Web Client
***Note:***
This page gets served locally with "http-server" (listed in the package.json as a dependency). We therefore **need to connect to a local Rails server running the BC FIRE API**, [BC Fire Feed](www.github.com/aylanismello/bc-fire-api). See installation instructions for that separately.


## Getting started

`git clone ${repo_name}`

`gem install foreman`

**OSX**

`brew install yarn`

`yarn install`

`yarn add global http-server`

`foreman start`

### What is foreman start?
foreman is a task/process manager for getting all the processes you need for running fire-feed-web up and running locally.

If you peek at the `Procfile` you'll see all the processes (just BASH commands)
that we're running when we type in `foreman start`
